We combine the power of clinical-grade products that are customized for your type of acne, with a series of bi-monthly treatments. We also teach you about other aggravating factors that make you break out &ndash; foods, medications, cosmetics, stress, and common ingredients in skin care formulations that might be clogging your pores (even professional and prescription products).</p>",

You will learn how to use products slowly at first, so that your skin stays receptive without causing irritation or dehydration. But skin can become accustomed to products and then become less effective over time &ndash; that is why we will adjust your regimen little by little, to get rid of your acne.</p>",

We started off using the strongest antibacterials we had to get his inflammation under control in the quickest manner possible. We wanted to get the inflammation down as soon as possible to avoid the scarring that could happen if it was left unchecked. His acne cleared up in four month’s time and he was left with minimal scarring. Francisco and his father drove 1.5 hours (one way) to get to our clinic.",

              "testimonial": "Face Reality has done wonders for my skin. I have been trying different products, dermatologists, Chinese herbs, and antibiotics for over 15 years (I can’t believe it’s been that long!). I didn’t want to take any more antibiotics. My dermatologist was recommending Accutane – which I have taken twice before. The second time I had a reaction that I’m told one-in-a-million people have – I had breakout on top of breakout, it was scarring in many ways. Anyway, I wasn’t about to take Accutane and I was tired of topical prescriptions making my face flake and burn. I found Face Reality online. It was actually their guarantee that got me to try it. I had blown so much money (and time) on products that didn’t work for me – at least I could get some money back to try something else But I don’t need the money back because my skin is so much better. I have been seeing Laura and Julie for 6 months. After 3 months I rarely had a breakout – I was told that this would be the case on my first visit, but I found it hard to believe. My skin has finally been able to heal, my scars are smoothing out, and the redness is going away. The office is comfortable and clean. I really don’t like walking into a dermatologist office and seeing huge posters of people with flawless skin – which I’m supposed to believe was achieved with some laser or peel which is way out of my price range. There are no such posters at Face Reality. I like the products, they are within the price range of other systems, but they actually work and last for months. They don’t want your skin to be overly dry or peeling so they will adjust what you’re using and how much. I am so happy that I found Face Reality. They have completely changed my skin for the better. I find their hours to be very customer friendly. They’ve been on time for every one of my appointments. I can’t say enough good things about them; I just wish I had found them 15 years ago!",

Much to her dismay, her chin area started breakout out with inflamed lesions like she had never experienced before in her life. Her doctor told her to just keep using it, that it was just a “flare-up” that sometimes accompanies retinoid use and that it would get better. Well, it didn’t get better and she decided to give us a try. We got her clear in six weeks using the right combination of exfoliants and anti-bacterial products (without any “flare up”).",
              "testimonial": "I am writing to say how very pleased I am with the services I have received from Face Reality SkinCare. Thanks to Laura’s expertise and skill, my skin has shown significant improvement in a very short period of time. I was in my mid-30s when I first starting having notable problems with acne. My breakouts were relatively mild at first, but the problem was very persistent and it gradually got worse. I tried various treatment options (over the counter products; then Differin and Clindamycin through a dermatologist) – none of these worked for me. I became very discouraged about my skin’s condition and my lack of progress on the regimen my dermatologist prescribed – my skin was actually getting markedly worse instead of better. From the very first appointment with Laura, I immediately felt optimistic that my skin would improve. She told me that she could clear me up quickly – and the confidence with which she said this, along with her positive attitude, really made a difference in how I felt about my situation. After a few weeks of receiving services, my skin started to clear up very rapidly and has continued to improve throughout the course of treatment. All of the inflamed acne on my chin cleared up within the first few weeks. Previously, I also had problems with clogged pores and breakouts on my forehead – all of that cleared up within the first couple of weeks and it has stayed clear. I’m very pleased with the progress I have seen in such a short period of time. My friends and co-workers have even commented on how much better my skin looks now. The services at Face Reality Skin Care have always been provided in a professional and supportive manner. I really appreciate the fact that between appointments, Laura and Patrick are available for questions; they have always responded very quickly to any messages I have left. I would like to add that the clinic has a very friendly, warm atmosphere – it is truly a nice place to come to (even though I am here to deal with a less than pleasant problem!). I really couldn’t be happier with the services I have received and would highly recommend Laura’s services to anyone struggling with skin problems.",

I’ve continued to use their amazing products that has kept my skin maintained so very well. I am completely satisfied with their service, performance and results. I would definitely recommend Face Reality to anyone and everyone. If you are tired of the way your skin looks go to Face Reality, I bet you will see amazing and very satisfying results.

She has noninflamed resistive type of acne and her skin was not at all sensitive, so I put her on very strong home care right from the beginning and had her come in for a medium-depth “Propeel” (a TCA peel from Vivant Pharmaceuticals). Her skin cleared up in about ten weeks. We are now working to lift her sun damage from the years she lived in Maui.",
              "testimonial": "I have had problem skin since 6th grade and it was always really frustrating!! I never felt beautiful or confident! I even had a dermatologist nurse tell me I was never going to have clear skin. I had tried everything, I was beginning to think that nurse was right. Then I saw the ad for face reality and was skeptical but I had already spent thousands of dollars on things that didn’t work so why not try one more. I was really surprised when Laura guaranteed I would have clear skin. On my first visit she told me I had grade two acne which is the hardest to get rid of, so I was a little bummed. The amazing part was that after I started using her products my acne cleared up, even she was amazed at how fast it worked!!! It is great that I don’t feel scared to go out without make-up any more and I get compliments on my skin! I’m so thankful because I feel like I have a normal life now. Acne can be totally devastating and I know first hand! I wanted to just hide-out when I had acne now I don’t have to worry about my skin at all it is totally AWESOME!!!",

Unlike products like Proactive or Murad, which is similar to the “one size fits all” type scenario, Face Reality customizes a plan just for you, so it is guaranteed to fix any concerns you have.\n<br><br>\nStaff is friendly and extremely knowledgable and the prices aren’t bad either. About the same as proactive but the products are much better. Plus you get the added benefit of a spa type atmosphere: nice music in ambient lighted rooms. It is very relaxing. You don’t get that from infomercials. So, if you have concerns with your skin, give them a call, I know they can help you, they sure helped me!!!",

She said “Oh I went there..” and I said but you have perfect skin and she said “I do now!”. I made an appointment for two days later and have never looked back. Is my skin absolutely perfect – no but it is AMAZINGLY GOOD CONSISTENTLY!!! Once I was at the clinic, I found that one of their staff had actually worked at one of the dermatologists I had gone to at one time. We talked about how Face Reality’s approach was so different to how that dermatologist had tried to approach acne. The other miracle that Face Reality has given me has been in treating the dark pigmentation from old acne scars.",

She needlessly spent thousands on products and services that didn’t work for her. I looked at the products she was using and saw pore-clogging ingredients in them and the serums they had given her were more for anti-aging and no ingredients in them that would help her acne or help to lighten the dark spots on her face. We got her onto a regimen for noninflamed Acne and also for lifting the dark spots – her acne was mostly gone in three months and the dark spots were gone in six months.",

I had gone to dermatologists and even prescription medications didn’t work. I was convinced nothing would work.\n<br><br>Then, I came across a place I thought would do the trick—microdermabrasions and corrective peels sounded like just what I needed. I nervously plopped down $800 [or so] for the treatments and another $200 for the facial products. For about six months and thousands of dollars later, there was no change with my skin-and, of course, there were no refunds.<br><br>\n\nFinally, my mom found the article for Face Reality and I was completely skeptical. I kept the article, though, for about a month while I finished up my remaining treatments at the other place. I had one treatment left and decided to call Face Reality.<br><br>To make a long story short, I am still a client at Face Reality and my skin has never looked so great. I get so many compliments from people and my self esteem has shot through the roof. Needless to say, I never made my last appointment for the other place. Thanks Face Reality!!",

I recognized right away that it looked like rosacea to me. I treated him and put him on our home care for rosacea. Within six weeks his face was completely clear.

When you’re 60 years old you don’t expect to have skin that looks like adolescent acne. So I scheduled an appointment with a Harvard trained dermatologist, supposedly the best in Marin County. I was seeing him for 3 years. He had me on 3 different types of antibiotics, a synthetic retinoid, LED light treatment and a variety of prescription topicals. Sometimes my skin would improve a bit, but I never came close to getting clear. Then one day my wife saw an article in the Marin Independent Journal about Face Reality. She finally got me to make an appointment and am I glad she did. Laura got me completely clear in six weeks and with products that are a lot safer than what the dermatologist had me taking. I think they’re terrific.",
