After all, she knew first-hand how adversely it had affected her life; and she wanted to spare others the agony of dealing with acne.</p>\n<p><br>She became a California state-licensed esthetician in 1990 and set out to learn everything about acne that she could. After having been a sole practitioner for many years, her dream of opening an acne-only clinic came true in 2005. As a result of her astounding results with acne, other&nbsp;estheticians started demanding classes to learn her protocol. Out of this was born her comprehensive Acne Specialist training and she has certified over 400 skin care professionals, including nurses and doctors, around the United States.&nbsp;</p>",

We combine the power of clinical-grade products that are customized for your type of acne, with a series of bi-monthly treatments.

You will learn how to use products slowly at first, so that your skin stays receptive without causing irritation or dehydration. But skin can become accustomed to products and then become less effective over time &ndash; that is why we will adjust your regimen little by little, to get rid of your acne.</p>",

We wanted to get the inflammation down as soon as possible to avoid the scarring that could happen if it was left unchecked. His acne cleared up in four month’s time and he was left with minimal scarring. Francisco and his father drove 1.5 hours (one way) to get to our clinic.",

Her skin cleared up in about ten weeks. We are now working to lift her sun damage from the years she lived in Maui.",
              "testimonial": "I have had problem skin since 6th grade and it was always really frustrating!! I never felt beautiful or confident! I even had a dermatologist nurse tell me I was never going to have clear skin. I had tried everything, I was beginning to think that nurse was right. Then I saw the ad for face reality and was skeptical but I had already spent thousands of dollars on things that didn’t work so why not try one more. I was really surprised when Laura guaranteed I would have clear skin. On my first visit she told me I had grade two acne which is the hardest to get rid of, so I was a little bummed. The amazing part was that after I started using her products my acne cleared up, even she was amazed at how fast it worked!!! It is great that I don’t feel scared to go out without make-up any more and I get compliments on my skin! I’m so thankful because I feel like I have a normal life now. Acne can be totally devastating and I know first hand! I wanted to just hide-out when I had acne now I don’t have to worry about my skin at all it is totally AWESOME!!!",

With the right products, her skin cleared in a little over three months.\n<br> <br>I suffered with acne for 18 years before finding Face Reality. Over the years I have visited 7 dermatologists on THREE continents. I have taken antibiotics, Accutane, used every cream known to man for treatment of acne, purchased all kinds of things advertised on TV in desperation, been told this was just the way it is for me, paid for peels and more peels, tried herbs and vitamins, you name it.",

I went back to my office and mentioned this to a work colleague. I told her my friend had been going to a place called Face Reality. She said “Oh I went there..” and I said but you have perfect skin and she said “I do now!”. I made an appointment for two days later and have never looked back. Is my skin absolutely perfect – no but it is AMAZINGLY GOOD CONSISTENTLY!!! Once I was at the clinic, I found that one of their staff had actually worked at one of the dermatologists I had gone to at one time. We talked about how Face Reality’s approach was so different to how that dermatologist had tried to approach acne. The other miracle that Face Reality has given me has been in treating the dark pigmentation from old acne scars.",

He gave me a long list of medications (mostly antibiotics) that his doctor had given him for the past four years. He was still getting new pustules every day and was very embarassed by them. I recognized right away that it looked like rosacea to me. I treated him and put him on our home care for rosacea. Within six weeks his face was completely clear. He also had some rosacea lesions on his body which cleared up as well.",
              "testimonial": "I’m not that vain but as a business owner, I still found it embarrassing when I’d go into a business meeting, knowing how my skin looked. When you’re 60 years old you don’t expect to have skin that looks like adolescent acne. So I scheduled an appointment with a Harvard trained dermatologist, supposedly the best in Marin County. I was seeing him for 3 years. He had me on 3 different types of antibiotics, a synthetic retinoid, LED light treatment and a variety of prescription topicals. Sometimes my skin would improve a bit, but I never came close to getting clear. Then one day my wife saw an article in the Marin Independent Journal about Face Reality. She finally got me to make an appointment and am I glad she did. Laura got me completely clear in six weeks and with products that are a lot safer than what the dermatologist had me taking. I think they’re terrific.",

              "testimonial": "I’ve had a moderate case of back acne since high school. It was always a bit embarrassing to wear a bathing suit or any clothing with my back exposed, and I didn’t think anything could be done to help it. What initially attracted me to Face Reality was its name, but what kept me coming back was seeing my back get progressively clearer and smoother each time I had a treatment. Looking back (no pun intended!), I have no regrets about visiting the clinic and highly recommend it for anyone who wants to look and feel their best.",
